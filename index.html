    <h3> Hello friends!</h3> 
    <p>My name is Michelle Mason and I currently live in sunny Redondo Beach, California. I'm a software engineering student at Thinkful with a background in public health. My experience in public health and exposure to web development has interested me in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating programs that encourage people to make healthy decisions</li>
      <li>Producing programs that make health data easily understood by the public</li>
      <li>Constructing systems that can track and express health information in meaningful ways</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
    <p>When I finished college with my public health degree, I spent a year working in that industry when I began to feel that my career was missing something. I felt as if I was stagnant and wasn't encountering any growth. I yearned for more challenging situations that would require me to learn and grow. This led me to finding out about code! </p>

    <p>After learning about web development, I spent much of my time reading and studying the career and life in this industry. After months of this research and deciding this is exactly what I needed, I began my journey at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>!</p>

    <p>I am beyond excited to learn and grow as a web developer and can't wait to work with a team that pushes each other to grow. I am naturally a people person so I am eager to work with different people to collaborate and create new ideas. Like the old saying goes, two heads are better than one!</p>

    <p>When I'm not studying or working on code, I love being outside. I am an avid hiker, fisher, and if I had it my way, I would be camping every weekend. Nature and code work together as the loop that brings me joy in my life.</p>
